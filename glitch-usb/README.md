# Glitch a USB device

This is inspired by the [facewhisperer project](https://github.com/scanlime/facewhisperer)
but instead of using a custom board with Xmega + MAX3241E we are
going to use Arduino Uno + USB Host Shield 2.0 and mimic the same thing.

Clocks:

 - Arduino 16Mhz
 - MAX3241E 12Mhz
 - AGPTek 24Mhz
